While chomsky is still largely underdevelopment, its purpose is to provide a way by 
which data processing could be done on political data (articles, opinions, 
speeches, etc.) to see how current events changed the political rhetoric.

This project I started at the begining of the current political 
campaign cycle that would aggregate news articles from certain websites, parse them for 
content and then do simple natural language tool kit analysis on their composition.
